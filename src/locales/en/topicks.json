  "description": "This time, inspired by my favorite Japanese TV show 'Another Sky', I revisited my roots in New Zealand and reflected in an 'Another Sky style'. This is a complete reproduction and my own expression of returning to my roots. No comedy, no variety shows, fully serious with a mix of English and a little Japanese throughout. This is likely a one-time project. While filming, I felt embarrassed at times, but I tried my best to express my thoughts and feelings through trial and error. If you love or are interested in New Zealand, I would be very happy if you enjoy watching the video. Starting from 2025, I will do my best to express myself through video. Thank you for your support!",
