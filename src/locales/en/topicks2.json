  "description": "I would like to announce that I have officially started working independently as a UI/UX designer. Honestly, it was a very difficult and uncertain decision, but I am committed to helping clients bring their visions to life. Starting in 2025, I will challenge myself with new things one step at a time, even when they seem impossible. As this is the final year of my 20s, I want to face the future with no regrets, remain grateful to everyone who has supported me, and continue to work hard and grow. I am preparing for many new projects and hope to share more exciting updates with you soon. I aim to expand my activities not only in Japan but also globally. Please stay tuned for future announcements. For work inquiries, feel free to contact me via Instagram DM or through the contact form.",
